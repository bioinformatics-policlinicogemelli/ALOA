## Features
- Spatial **Data** Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

    The first step is the merge of cell seg data files of each roi. This files are merged into a single file, for each patient. <br>With the option "", it's possibile to remove cells that don't have any of the phenotypes of interest (OTHER). <br>

    The results can be saved into:<br>
    - <em>output/Merged_clean</em><br>
                or
    - <em>output/Merged</em><br>
